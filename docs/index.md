The Physical Information File (PIF) is a schema that is designed to impose structure on information about physical systems. Schema design, as well as tools for working with PIF-formatted files using the python ([pypif](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/pypif)) and java ([jpif](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/jpif)) programming languages are maintained by [Citrine Informatics](http://www.citrine.io).

This site will continue to be updated with examples and new definitions as the schema is further developed.

The Citrination API is backed by a powerful [query language](!api/search/pif/query) that allows for granular filtering on the data that is stored on Citrination.  Individual [results](!api/search/pif/result) are returned in the [PIF schema](http://citrine.io/pif).

The query language exactly mirrors the hierarchy of the [PIF schema](http://citrine.io/pif). Users are encouraged to become familiar with that schema before using the query language.

properties:
    fromIndex:
        type: number
        format: integer
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: The index of the first record to return. This is used for pagination through results.
    size:
        type: number
        format: integer
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: The number of records to return. This is used for pagination through results. The number of hits that are returned will never be greater than this number, but may be smaller if there are fewer records in the scope of the query or if the maximum number of records that the server will allow to be returned is exceeded (this is typically 100).
    randomResults:
        type: boolean
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: Whether a random set of results should be returned. If not specified, the default value is false.
    randomSeed:
        type: number
        format: int32
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: The seed to the pseudo-random number generator used to generate random results. If not specified, a value based on the current time will be used. This should be used when paginating through results; if not specified, a different random seed will be generated for each request and there may be duplicate records between sets of results.
    scoreRelevance:
        type: boolean
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: Whether to score relevance in queries. If not specified, the relevancy score is not tracked.
    returnMaxScore:
        type: boolean
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: Whether to return the maximum score over all hits in scope, not just the results that are returned. This only has meaning when scoreRelevance is set to true. If not specified, the default value of this setting is false.
    timeout:
        type: number
        format: int32
        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: The maximum time, in milliseconds, to wait for the query to finish execution. An effort is made to respect this timeout though there is no guarantee that the request will be terminated at exactly this time. If not specified, the default value of this setting is 60000 (equal to 60 seconds).
